#Database:
Necessary seeding included in model
php artisan db:seed


#Stack
Laravel 5.7.22
PHP 7.3.1
MySQL Community Server 5.7.25

#Time spent
8 hours, not counting the time to read up on documentation for PHP and Laravel.
The time spent could have been pushed down without the use of a framework, but I wanted hands-on experience with real framework technology being used, and not vanilla PHP.
